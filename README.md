# MyToken Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case with a simple ERC-20 token called **MyToken (MTK)**.  
It includes the smart contract and tests for that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
